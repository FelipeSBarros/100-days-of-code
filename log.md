# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 
##### Started the project [Robot Bird Watching](https://github.com/FelipeSBarros/RoBirdWatching#robotwatching-project-100daysofcode)
The [Robot Bird Watching](https://github.com/FelipeSBarros/RoBirdWatching#robotwatching-project-100daysofcode) project is a bit ambicious. So I will be developing it by baby steps and modularly. The fist module will be building a workflow of getting data, saving it on a databse, sharing thru the internet.
Started building a #python webscrapping function with #beatifulsoup module saving the result in #sqlite3;
**Today's Progress**: understood a bit more about webscrap; learned about sqlite3.

**Thoughts:** Amazed with sqlite3. Easy and fast!
